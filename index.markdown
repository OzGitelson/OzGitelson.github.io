I'm a junior at Yale pursuing a BS/MS in Computer Science.
Outside of classes, I am a researcher in the Social Robotics Lab, where I
study stress detection and human-robot collaboration. Through this work, I have contributed to multiple advances, such as an
audio-visual stress detector hundreds of times faster than existing methods, a novel, extremely high quality stress dataset, and a therapy robot currently being deployed in hospitals, wellness clinics, and schools.
